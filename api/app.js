/*  
Welcome to the REST API Challenge for Hacktoberfest 2023, Created by the FOSS Community of NSBM.

In this Challenge, you have the creative freedom to design your `app.js` file as you see fit. 
Express.js is a versatile framework, and you can structure your application in various ways 
to suit your specific needs.

Feel free to organize your code, create additional files/modules/directories, or use any libraries 
you find useful to build your API.

The structure and functionality of this will depend on the approach that you try to solve the 
challenge,so make it your own and have fun coding!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
