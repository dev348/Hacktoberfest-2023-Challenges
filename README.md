### PARTICIPATING IN HACKTOBERFEST

#### Here’s what you need to know to participate and complete Hacktoberfest

- Register anytime between September 26 and October 31.
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub or GitLab hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic).
- Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total.
- The first 50,000 participants to have their first PR/MR accepted will have a tree planted in their name through Tree Nation.
- Participants with four pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 will receive a unique digital reward.

### PULL/MERGE REQUEST DETAILS
#### Here’s how we validate contributor pull/merge requests (“PR/MRs”) for Hacktoberfest.

##### [OUT-OF-BOUNDS] YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF HACKTOBERFEST.
- Your PR/MRs must be created between October 1 and October 31 (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14).
- Your PR/MRs must be made to a public, unarchived repository.
#### [EXCLUDED] REPOS THAT GO AGAINST HACKTOBERFEST’S VALUES WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM QUALIFICATION AND PR/MRS MADE TO THOSE REPOS WON’T COUNT.
- Found a repository that goes against the values of Hacktoberfest? Let us know and we’ll take a look.
#### [SPAM] YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE SPAMMY.
##### PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word “spam” by maintainers will not be counted.
- We use the Node.js 18 RegEx engine with /\bspam\b/i to look for spam labels.
- PR/MRs that also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
- PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word “invalid” cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
- PR/MRs that our system detects as spammy will also not be counted.
##### Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.

#### [PARTICIPATING] YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE IN A REPO TAGGED WITH THE “HACKTOBERFEST” TOPIC, OR HAVE THE “HACKTOBERFEST-ACCEPTED” LABEL.

- Hacktoberfest is now opt-in for maintainers, so only contribute to projects that indicate they’re looking for Hacktoberfest PR/MRs.
- Once your PR/MR has passed this check, we won’t check this again (unless your PR/MR fails a check before this, such as it being marked as spammy).

#### [INVALID] YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE LABELED AS “INVALID”.
- PR/MRs that have a label containing the word “invalid” won’t be counted, unless they also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label.
Specifically, we use the Node.js 18 RegEx engine with /\binvalid\b/i to look for invalid labels.

#### [ACCEPTED] YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE MERGED, HAVE THE “HACKTOBERFEST-ACCEPTED” LABEL, OR HAVE AN OVERALL APPROVING REVIEW.

- Your PR/MR must not be a draft to be considered accepted.
- If your PR/MR is being accepted for Hacktoberfest via an overall approving review it must also not be closed.

#### ONCE YOUR PR/MRS PASS ALL THE CHECKS ABOVE, IT WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR HACKTOBERFEST AFTER THE SEVEN DAY REVIEW PERIOD.

- We continually evaluate all of the checks except the [participating] check. If it fails any of these checks during this time, the seven day timer will reset.
- After the seven day review period completes, your PR/MR will be automatically accepted for Hacktoberfest assuming it still passes all the checks. Once accepted for Hacktoberfest, we stop checking. :party:
